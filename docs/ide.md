## IDE Integration

There are many IDEs supporting golang since it is static-type, e.g., [VSCode](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go)/[IDEA](https://github.com/go-lang-plugin-org/go-lang-idea-plugin)/[Gogland](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/).

Usually, these IDEs ask user to set `GOPATH` and prepare dependent package there before developing. Gogradle try to make it easier. Ideally, a user should be able to start development after checking out the code immediately, without understanding or setting anything.
